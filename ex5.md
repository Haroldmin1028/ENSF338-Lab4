1.  timeit.timeit() is most useful when computing the total time of a certain number of iterations, and it can be used to compute the average time by dividing the total time by the number of iterations. timeit.repeat() is useful when analyzing the variance of performance since it outputs a list of times, and list methods can easily find the maximum and minimum times.
2.  timeit.timeit() should use the average statistic because it outputs only one element at a time, so it would be appropriate to divide the outputted number by the number inputted in  the number parameter to find the average of one time measure. timeit.repeat() provides a list of times of the number provided in the repeat parameter. Since it provides a list of values, we could easily use list methods to find the minimum and maximum times.

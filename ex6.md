1.  Arrays have the advantage of easily accessing elements using indexes, which make retrievals and replacements O(1) if the index is known. However, adding and removing elements have worse complexity the closer the element is to the beginning of the list, since the remaining elements need to all be shifted. Adding elements may also result in the array going over its capacity, which requires the arrays needing to be copied to another place in storage, expending more time. Linked lists have a better complexity when inserting and removing elements, in which they are O(1) if the index of where to insert and remove is known. However, it may go to O(n) with the need to traverse through the list to find the correct element. It also does not have the problem of needing to copy the array elsewhere since its elements are stored non-contiguously. However, it cannot access elements easily through indexing, and needs to traverse through the elements (linear search, O(n)) to find the element to access.
2.  The size of the array will remain the same after the full operation, and it will never go over capacity because it deletes the element before inserting the new one. A way to implement the new function would be to copy the elements before and after the modification into a new array for the deletion, then insert the new element into the original array for the insertion and replacement.
3.  Insertion sort would be good to implement, because the doubly linked list makes it easy to access and compare the element left of the current element. As the current element traverses towards the head, the swapping would involve the next pointer of the previous element moved from the current to the next element, and the current element would not be lost since it can be accessed by the previous pointer of the next element. There will always be a pointer pointing to any element during the swap, ensuring no element gets lost during the swap. Merge sort would be more difficult to implement, since it involves splitting every element then ordering and merging them back together, and splitting would involve disconnecting every node's next and previous pointers. Once each node is split, the elements would be compared and merged into longer and longer linked lists until the full linked list is returned, ordered. Ordering the linked sublists during the merging process is O(n) with the need to traverse through the sublists to compare the elements and find the correct position for each element to be in. Traversing the subarrays to find the correct index is facilitated by the previous pointers. 
4.  For regular arrays, insertion sort would have complexity of O(n^2), where it is O(n) for each element traversing left through the array, and O(n) for the number of elements in the array. In linked lists, it is O(1) for swapping positions, however it is O(n) just to traverse through the list to find the correct position, making it still O(n^2). Merge sort in arrays is always O(n log n) because of the splitting of arrays with O(log n) then merging O(n), and it is the same with the linked list. However, the space complexity is O(1) because with the doubly linked list, additional space is not required to merge like it is for arrays.
